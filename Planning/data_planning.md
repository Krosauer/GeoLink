# Planning for Country Attributes

### All UN recognized countries will be included in the dataset. The dataset will include the following attributes for each country:
- Country Name (from REST Countries API)
- Country Code (from REST Countries API)
- UN member (from REST Countries API)
- Lanuages (from REST Countries API)
- Currecies (from REST Countries API)
- Landlocked (from REST Countries API)
- Borders (from REST Countries API)
- Population (from REST Countries API)
- Area (from REST Countries API)
- Timezones (from REST Countries API)


### Ideas for additional attributes:
- GDP 
- Climate
- Alliances
- Religion
- Flag colors
- Shared rivers or bodies of water
- Something with Airports/Direct flights
- Trade partners
- Doubly landlocked (There's only 2 countries)
- Population density
